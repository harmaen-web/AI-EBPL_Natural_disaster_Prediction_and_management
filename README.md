 AI-Based Natural Disaster Prediction and Visualization

✅ Features

» Interactive disaster location map (Folium)

» Chatbot assistant for emergency tips and queries

 »Flood prediction results with confusion matrix and classification report

» Map exported as HTML and GitHub-viewable

✅ Technology Used

» Python 3.x

» Folium (Map visualization)

» Scikit-learn (Classification report, confusion matrix)

» Matplotlib (Visualization of confusion matrix)

» Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

✅ How It Works

» Sample data simulates past disaster events.

» Folium renders a map with red markers based on disaster locations.

» A simple chatbot responds to flood safety and prediction queries.

» Model evaluation (y_true vs. y_pred) is displayed using scikit-learn.

» Output map is saved as disaster_map.html.

✅ Data Collection

» Simulated disaster and prediction data for demonstration purposes.

You may replace with real-time data from APIs like OpenWeather, USGS, or NDMA.

✅ Objective

To build a prototype that predicts and visualizes natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes) and assists users with guidance during crises.

✅ Controls

Run the code to:

Generate the interactive map

Interact with chatbot
Display prediction evaluation
Enter commands like:
flood
predict
exit

✅ ML Techniques Used

» Confusion matrix for model evaluation

» Classification report for precision, recall, and F1-score

✅ Model Training

» This prototype uses static predictions. However, you can:

» Train models using real datasets (e.g., rainfall, river level, satellite images)

» Use decision trees, SVM, or neural networks

✅ Output Explanation

» disaster_map.html: Folium-generated map showing disaster types and severity

» Chatbot replies dynamically to user prompts

» Evaluation shows how well the flood model performs
